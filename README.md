# Not-Your-Typical-To-Do-List-App

More than just tasks — track your habits, goals, and progress in one clean, focused space.  
Built with love (and a few late nights) by **kcat28**, this personal project is designed to help you stay accountable without the overwhelm.  
Simple, intentional, and made for real-life routines.

Powered by **Vite**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase**

🚧 Project Status
This project is currently paused — not in active development or deployment.
While I don’t plan to finish it soon, I’m still proud of what I explored and learned while building it.
It served as a great hands-on exercise with React, Firebase, and modern frontend tooling.
